
I know how to video edit, though I have not done too much. My Youtube is YahwehIsMyEl. I have posted some Minecraft videos and other videos there that are ok to review. I am also familiar with replay mod.

I also have a computer that is pretty good, and I can record with shaders at 60fps in Java 1.19, and I also have access to Bedrock RTX.

It is  basically a really nice minecraft "camera" that some people may not have access to to showcase their builds, so if someone wants a really nice screenshot of their build but can't load shaders or RTX, I could load their world, take the screenshot and send it to them. Or recording as well.
